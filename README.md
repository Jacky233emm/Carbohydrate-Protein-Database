# Carbohydrate-Protein-Database

positive database (coodinated-constrained relaxed) :
	ndv2: 6827 files, origin carbohydrate-protein complex database from RCSB after processing
	ndv3: 3387 files, sequence identity < 25% in ndv2
	ndv4: 2093 files, Rosetta ddg_seperated < -5 and hbonds_int>1 in ndv3
	ndv6: 981 files, PDB resolution <2 in ndv4

negative database (relaxed):
	negative: 4969 files, generated carbohydrate-protein complexes by Rosetta, either lack of interaction or have improper interaction on interface
